# js-fizzbuzz

### FizzBuzz in JavaScript.

This is the first of my adventures into JavaScript. 

### Usage

- Fork or clone this repo. 
  `git clone git@github.com:dmcd84/js-fizzbuzz.git`
- Run the tests but opening the SpecRunner in a web broswer - this will have to be the full path, not the project path.
